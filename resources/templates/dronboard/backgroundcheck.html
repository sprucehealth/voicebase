		<h3>CONSUMER DISCLOSURE AND AUTHORIZATION FORM</h3>

		<h4>Disclosure Regarding Background Investigation</h4>

		<p>Spruce Health, Inc. (the “Company”) may request, for lawful employment purposes, background information about you from a consumer reporting agency in connection with your employment or application for employment (including independent contractor assignments, as applicable).  This background information may be obtained in the form of consumer reports and/or investigative consumer reports (commonly known as “background reports”).  An “investigative consumer report” is a background report that includes information from personal interviews (except in California, where that term includes background reports with or without information obtained from personal interviews), the most common form of which is checking personal or professional references. These background reports may be obtained at any time after receipt of your authorization and, if you are hired or engaged by the Company, throughout your employment or your contract period, as allowed by law.</p>

		<p>HireRight, Inc. (“HireRight”), or another consumer reporting agency, will prepare or assemble the background reports for the Company.  HireRight is located and can be contacted by mail at 5151 California, Irvine, CA 92617, and HireRight can be contacted by phone at (800) 400-2761.  Information about HireRight’s privacy practices is available at <a href="http://www.hireright.com/Privacy-Policy.aspx" target="_new">www.hireright.com/Privacy-Policy.aspx</a>.</p>

		<p>The background report may contain information concerning your character, general reputation, personal characteristics, mode of living, and credit standing.  The types of information that may be obtained include, but are not limited to: social security number verifications; address history; credit reports and history; criminal records and history; public court records; driving records; accident history; worker’s compensation claims; bankruptcy filings; educational history verifications (e.g., dates of attendance, degrees obtained); employment history verifications (e.g., dates of employment, salary information, reasons for termination, etc.); personal and professional references checks; professional licensing and certification checks; drug/alcohol testing results, and drug/alcohol history in violation of law and/or company policy; and other information bearing on your character, general reputation, personal characteristics, mode of living and credit standing.</p>

		<p>This information may be obtained from private and public record sources, including, as appropriate: government agencies and courthouses; educational institutions; former employers; and, for investigative consumer reports, personal interviews with sources such as neighbors, friends, former employers and associates; and other information sources.  If the Company should obtain information bearing on your credit worthiness, credit standing or credit capacity for reasons other than as required by law, then the Company will use such credit information to evaluate whether you would present an unacceptable risk of theft or other dishonest behavior in the job for which you are being evaluated.</p>

		<p>You may request more information about the nature and scope of an investigative consumer report, if any, by contacting the Company.</p>

		<p>A summary of your rights under the Fair Credit Reporting Act, as well as certain state-specific notices, are also being provided to you.</p>

		<h4>ADDITIONAL STATE LAW NOTICES</h4>
