	<h2>What Service Does Spruce Provide?</h2>

	<p>Our Service is designed to enable you to obtain telemedicine consultations and treatment for common medical conditions by facilitating the connection between you and a licensed healthcare provider (a “Provider”). Once you are assigned one or more Providers through our Service, each of those Providers may be referred to as “your Provider.” Your Provider is solely responsible for providing you with medical care. We act as a technology platform to connect you with professional healthcare Providers who may be available to provide you with certain non-emergency medical care. We do not control or interfere with the practice of medicine by Providers, each of whom is responsible for the medical services he or she provides.</p>

	<div class="simplystated">
		<p>Simply Stated: Spruce provides the technology to connect you with licensed healthcare Providers for non-emergency telemedicine consultations, but only your Provider can make decisions about your medical care and treatment.</p>
	</div>

	<hr>

	<h2>Medical Emergencies</h2>

	<p>THE MEDICAL CARE YOU RECEIVE FROM YOUR PROVIDER THROUGH SPRUCE IS NOT A SUBSTITUTE FOR OTHER MEDICAL TREATMENT YOU MAY NEED. IF YOU ARE EXPERIENCING A MEDICAL EMERGENCY, CALL 911 OR SEEK EMERGENCY MEDICAL HELP.</p>

	<div class="simplystated">

	<hr>

	<h2>Fees and Purchase Terms</h2>

	<p>The fees for telemedicine consultations with healthcare Providers can be found on our Service. Fees are subject to change, and any changes will be posted. It is your responsibility to remain informed about the current rates. Spruce, on behalf of your Provider, will charge you for medical services provided by your Provider, and you agree to pay for all medical services provided to you.</p>

By providing Spruce with your Payment Provider and associated payment information, you agree that Spruce is authorized to invoice your Account at the time any payments are due and charge your designated Payment Provider account. If any payments are subject to sales tax in any jurisdiction, you also agree to pay the required sales tax, and any related penalties or interest. Spruce may automatically charge sales taxes for addresses within jurisdictions where such taxes are required. Unless otherwise agreed to by Spruce, all fees paid are non-refundable. You are responsible for all fees and charges associated with your Account.</p>

	<p>We use a third-party payment processor (the “Payment Processor”) to charge your Payment Provider account. The processing of payments in connection with your use of our Service will be subject to the terms, conditions and privacy policies of the Payment Processor and the Payment Provider responsible for your designated method of payment, in addition to this Agreement with Spruce. We are not responsible for any errors by the Payment Processor or the Payment Provider.</p>

	<p>At present we do not process any insurance claims, nor will your Provider process claims on your behalf. It is solely up to you to contact your health plan, determine whether your coverage applies, and submit a claim if applicable. You are responsible for the full fee charged for Provider care through our Service regardless of whether you later are able to receive reimbursement from your health plan for part or all of the cost.</p>

	<div class="simplystated">
		<p>Simply Stated: The current fees for telemedicine consultations with healthcare Providers are posted on Spruce. You agree that Spruce is authorized to bill your account and charge your designated method of payment when payments are due, including any sales tax that may be required.

The validity, interpretation, construction and performance of these Terms of Use will be governed by the laws of the State of California, without giving effect to the principles of conflict of laws.  Any dispute arising under or relating to these Terms of Use will be resolved exclusively by final and binding arbitration in San Francisco, California, under the rules of the American Arbitration Association, except that either party may bring a claim related to intellectual property rights, or seek temporary and preliminary specific performance and injunctive relief, in any court of competent jurisdiction, without the posting of bond or other security.  The parties agree to the personal and subject matter jurisdiction and venue of the courts located in San Francisco, California, for any action related to these Terms of Use.  You may only resolve disputes with us on an individual basis and not as part of any class, consolidated or representative action.  Our failure to enforce any provision of these Terms will not constitute a waiver of such right.  If any provision is found to be invalid, the parties agree that the court should endeavor to give effect to the parties’ intentions as reflected in the provision, and that the other provisions of these Terms remain in full force and effect.  You agree that regardless of any statute or law to the contrary, any claim or cause of action related to these Terms of Use must be filed within one year after such claim arose or be forever barred.

	<h1>Privacy Policy and Provider Notice of Privacy Practices</h1>

	<hr>

	<div class="callout">
		<p>Note from Spruce: We encourage you to review our Privacy Policy so you feel comfortable with how your information is collected and used in our Service.</p>
	</div>

	<hr>


	<h2>Introduction</h2>

	<p>This Privacy Policy (“Privacy Policy”) is incorporated into our Terms of Use.  Therefore, terms used in this Privacy Policy that have been previously defined will have the same meanings as provided in our Terms of Use.  As with our Terms of Use, if we make any changes to our Privacy Policy, we will post the revised Privacy Policy and update the “Last Revised” date of the Privacy Policy.  Your use of our Service following any such change means you accept the revised Privacy Policy.</p>

	<p>We are committed to respecting the privacy of users of our Service.  We created this Privacy Policy to tell you how Spruce collects, uses and discloses information in order to provide you with our Service.</p>

	<p>In addition, even though Spruce is not a “covered entity” as defined in the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), your healthcare Provider assigned through our Service may be a “covered entity” and therefore subject to the provisions of HIPAA.  As a result, your Provider has adopted a HIPAA Notice of Privacy Practices (the “Notice of Privacy Practices”) to describe how your Provider uses and discloses your protected health information (“PHI”).  In connection with certain services we provide to or on behalf of your Provider, your Provider has requested that we disseminate to you the Provider’s Notice of Privacy Practices, which is attached to this Privacy Policy.  Spruce has agreed that its collection, use and disclosure of your PHI on behalf of your Provider will be done consistent with the Notice of Privacy Practices except to the extent you have authorized additional uses and disclosures under this Privacy Policy or other provisions of the Terms of Use.</p>

	<p>By accessing or using our Service, you accept the practices and policies outlined in this Privacy Policy; you hereby consent that we will collect, use and disclose your information as set forth in this Privacy Policy; and you acknowledge receipt of your Provider’s Notice of Privacy Practices.  If you are using our Service on behalf of an individual other than yourself, you represent that you are authorized by such individual to accept this Privacy Policy and the Provider’s Notice of Privacy Practices on such individual’s behalf.</p>
